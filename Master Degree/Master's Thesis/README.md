# Thesis

## Info
The goal of this thesis is to develop an algorithm based on neural networks to perform denoising of optical signals obtained by Raman spectroscopy in order to facilitate their interpretation and related applications. This is achieved through a parallel and residual neural network capable of isolating the Raman signal from spurious contributions and instrumental noise. The effort also focused on optimizing the neural network based on the study of different types and amounts of noise in the available datasets. This project is carried out through the collaboration with INFN (National Institute of Nuclear Physics) and the department of Physics at Sapienza, University of Rome.
