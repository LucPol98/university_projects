# Interactive Graphics

## Info
The following required features have been implemented within this sub-repository:
* Create a hierarchical model of a (simplified) sheep https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep, composed of the following parts: body; 4 legs, each one composed of 2 independent components (upper and lower leg); head; tail. All components are cubes, use the cube function present in the file. The sheep has a white/light grey color.
* Add a surface on which you position the sheep that corresponds to a grass field. Attach to it a texture (color, bump or both) to give the appearance of a grass field.
* Load or generate at least two more textures. A color texture to be attached to the front face of the head and a bump texture to be applied to the sides of the body to give the “wool effect”.
* Create a (very simplified) model of a fence and position it on the surface and near the sheep.
* Add a button that starts an animation of the sheep so that, starting from an initial position where it is in a walking mode, it walks on the surface towards the fence by moving (alternatively back and forth) the legs, then jumps over the fence and lands on the surface on the other side of the fence.
* Allow the user to move the camera before and during the animation.
