# Interactive Graphics

## Info
This project includes two homework assignments focused on building the basics of Computer Graphics such as scene rendering, shading, variable lighting, and animations with WebGL. The final project is instead the expression of a more complex use of webGL programming through the ThreeJS framework. Through it the game "Crossy Road" has been reimplemented in a simplified form. The two homework assignments were carried out independently and delivered during the second semester of the first year of the master's degree, while the project was carried out in a team and delivered at the end of the second semester of the first year of the master's degree.

# Interactive Graphics - Final Project

This is the repository of the final project of the Interactive Graphics course.

The proposed project is a re-implementation of the famous "Crossy Road" game. It features different difficulty levels, several environments, various user customizations in the main menu and different animations. Some aspects are based on the original game, while other features are the brainchild of programmers. The project was implemented using the advanced library "ThreeJS". The animations were implemented manually in WebGL via javascript.

***Advice:*** We advise using Chrome or Edge (Chromium version) for a better experience
