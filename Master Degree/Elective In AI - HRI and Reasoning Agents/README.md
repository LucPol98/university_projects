# Elective In AI - HRI and Reasoning Agents

## Info
The purpose of the project is to develop a social and interactive robot for peopleâ€™s entertainment. It allows to play a cooperative version of the Tower of Hanoi game, in which the user and the robot execute a move alternately. The robot is also able to advise the person on the most appropriate level for him, by collecting some data about the user through an initial phase of questions. Communication between the two agents has been implemented in different ways. Additionally, a planning problem has been solved in order for the robot to be able to choose the best action to achieve victory.
