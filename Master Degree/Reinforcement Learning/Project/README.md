# Reinforcement Learning

## Info
This sub-repo contains an homework and a project. The first is an approach to OpenAI Gym, while the project is based on a neural network that applies the TRPO Reinforcement Learning algorithm in order to let a half cheetah learn how to trot in the MuJoCo Advanced physics simulation of OpenAI Gym.

###[Report of the project](https://github.com/LucPol98/university_projects/blob/main/Master%20Degree/Reinforcement%20Learning/Project/ReportRL.pdf).
