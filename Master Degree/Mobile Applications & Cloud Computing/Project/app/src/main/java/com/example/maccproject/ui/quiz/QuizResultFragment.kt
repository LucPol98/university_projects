Jedi fight to bring peace and justice to the Galactic Republic, usually against the Sith, their arch-enemies as well as devotees of the Dark Side, but also against the prophets of the Dark Side. In the Jedi Temple of Coruscant resides the Jedi Council, which is the highest authority in the Order. Within the Order there is a very strict division into Classes. The most powerful and experienced Jedi, also called Jedi Masters, seek out children between the ages of 4 and 7 in whom the Force, measured in Midichlorians, is very powerful, in order to make them in turn Jedi. The new apprentices receive the rank of Padawan and progress, followed by one or more Masters, up to the rank of Jedi Knight, and then independently up to the rank of Jedi Master. Jedi must also follow precise rules, such as controlling emotions, not killing unarmed opponents, and cannot have romantic relationships (though many Jedi practice them secretly) with each other or with others."

Originally, the term \"Sith\" referred to the native species of the planet Korriban that was later subjugated and ruled by the Dark Jedi exiled by the Galactic Republic. Following centuries of cross-breeding (cultural and genetic), the word \"Sith\" was no longer used to identify a race, but rather membership and dedication to the philosophy and teachings of the dark side. Throughout their long history, the Sith commanded many empires and waged many wars and military campaigns; their influence gave rise to many cults and minor orders, which were technically not part of the Sith Order. Their members, however, combining their vision of the galaxy with ancient teachings, allowed the dark side to stand the test of time and once again cast its shadow over all living things. Such cults included the Naddists, the Disciples of Ragnos, the Krath, and the Sisters of the Night."
