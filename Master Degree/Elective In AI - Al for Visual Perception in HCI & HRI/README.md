# Elective In AI - Al for Visual Perception in HCI & HRI

## Info
A project in collaboration with INFN (National Institute of Nuclear Physics). It is based on the development of neural network based algorithms and signal denoising for Raman spectroscopy and related applications. This project involves the development of artificial intelligence algorithms and neural networks that can isolate the Raman signal from spurious non-linear contributions.
